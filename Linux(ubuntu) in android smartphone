# Linux(ubuntu) in android smartphone

Difficulty Level - Beginner/Intermediate

 

# Requirements:

- Smartphone/tablet… minimally recent…
- At least 5 to 10 GB of free space
- The slower the smartphone, the slower the machines will be.
- Termux(project info:[https://github.com/termux/termux-app](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)) → FDROID version
- Andronix Playstore or WEB→[https://andronix.app/](https://andronix.app/)

## Possibilities:

- Linux available:
    - Ubuntu
    - Kali
    - Debian
    - Arch
    - Manjaro
    - Fedora
    - Others…(actually, distributions from other sources other than andronix can be installed, but in my opinion this is the most stable).


### Process

1. Go to a browser and download F-DROID.
2. Go to Playstore and download andronix.
3. Open F-DROID.
4. Download termux terminal.
5. Open termux and do apt update, then apt upgrade.
6. Open andronix, choose the distribution, CLI (command line) or GLI (graphical interface) and the work environment.
7. In order to choose the distribution, andronix provides a text that is automatically copied and which has to be pasted into the termux terminal.
8. Configure system defaults and you are ready to use…
9. If you want to access via VNC connection (Localhost by default), just connect the server with the vncserver-start command in termux.

### Extras:

- After installing any system (including termux itself) it must be updated, in this case:

```bash
apt install update && apt upgrade
```

- The distribution comes with tigervnc pre-installed, that is, it can be used on [localhost](http://localhost) or not depending on the selected options.
To remotely access the system by IP, just put the -localhost option in.    

```bash
tigervncserver -localhost no
```

- The most stable installation option I tested was the Ubuntu 20.04/XFCE option.
